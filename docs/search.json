Now we want to split this in two columns, one for the binID , the second should contain the accession.\nSome new syntax for AWK:\n\nsplit() = the function ‘split’ divides a string into pieces\n$1 = The column we want to split\n“x” = The pattern we want to use for splitting\na = We name the ARRAY we generate ‘a’. An ARRAY is similar to a variable you just can store more information in the array we store the different pieces that were split\na[1] = retrieve the first part of the split array =E\na[2] = retrieve the second part of the split array =1\n\n\nawk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS=\"\\t\"}{split($1,a,\"-\")} {print $1,a[1],a[2]}' Input"
